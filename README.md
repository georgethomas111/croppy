# What is this?

This is the code for a worker written in rust which gets deployed on commit and merge. 

The intention is to make them work in a way an image api can be exposed that crops images.

# crop-rest

Okay thanks to chat-gpt I have a program which crates a cropped image in rust which accepts command line arguments
